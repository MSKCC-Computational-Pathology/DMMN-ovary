# Ovarian Cancer Segmentation
This repository provides source code for ovarian cancer segmentation using Deep Multi-Magnification Network. Deep Multi-Magnification Network automatically segments multiple tissue subtypes by a set of patches from multiple magnifications in histopathology whole slide images. The original Deep Multi-Magnification Network paper is published [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compmedimag.2021.101866) and its training and inference codes can be found [here](https://github.com/MSKCC-Computational-Pathology/DMMN).

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.6.7
* Pytorch 1.3.1
* OpenSlide 1.1.1
* Albumentations

## Inference
The main inference codes are `slidereader_coords.py` and `inference.py`. You first need to run `slidereader_coords.py` to generate patch coordinates to be segmented in input whole slide images. After generating patch coordinates, you may run `inference.py` to generate segmentation predictions of input whole slide images. The segmentation predictions will be saved under `imgs/` by default.

You may need to update the following variables before running `slidereader_coords.py`:
* `slides_to_read`: the list of whole slide images
* `coord_file`: an output file listing all patch coordinates

In adition to `model_path` and `out_path`, you may need to update the following variables before running `inference.py`:
* `n_classes`: the number of tissue subtype classes + 1
* `test file`: the list of patch coordinates generated by `slidereader_coords.py`
* `data_path`: the path where whole slide images are located

Please download **the pretrained ovarian model** [here](https://mskcc.box.com/s/ragtxbnaiqtsmykozgqk6qmr9917m2ay).

Note that segmentation predictions will be generated in 4-bit BMP format. The size limit for 4-bit BMP files is 2<sup>32</sup> pixels.
